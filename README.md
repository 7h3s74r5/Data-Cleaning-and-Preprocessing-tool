# Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing-tool
One of the key challenges when working with real-world data is the presence of inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and duplicates. This project automates the data preprocessing steps, making the data more suitable for analysis or machine learning models.
This tool preprocesses the data by- 
1.Removing duplicates
2.Handeling missing data
3.Handeling outliers 
and saves the cleaned dataset to the 'cleaned_data.csv' file
